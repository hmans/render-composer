"render-composer": minor
---

`RenderComposer` has been replaced with `RenderCanvas`, which now only wraps R3F's `Canvas`. Apps using Render Composer are now expected to declare both:

```tsx
function App() {
	return (
		<RenderCanvas>
			<RenderPipeline vignette bloom antiAliasing>
				{/* etc. */}
			</RenderPipeline>
		</RenderCanvas>
	)
}
```
